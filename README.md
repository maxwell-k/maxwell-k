# Hello, I'm Keith Maxwell

I go by `maxwell-k` many places online.

I contribute to and publish some open source software here on GitHub. More
often, I use my [GitLab account] because I've a lot of experience using GitLab
CI. I'm trying out Codeberg and that's where I host my [vimfiles].

I have a [profile on LinkedIn].

[gitlab account]: https://gitlab.com/maxwell-k

## History

This repository started as my first attempt at a blog on
<https://dev.to/maxwellk>. Those original posts can be found in the
[`dev.to`](/dev.to) directory.
