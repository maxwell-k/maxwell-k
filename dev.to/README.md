# How I post to dev.to

1.  Set a shell variable to a suitable [API key](https://dev.to/settings/account):

    ```sh
    API_KEY=░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░
    ```

2.  Either (a) create a new article or (b) choose an unpublished one to amend.

    (a) Create a new article:

    ```sh
    https POST dev.to/api/articles api-key:$API_KEY \
      article:='{"title": "hello", "body_markdown": "world"}'
    ```

    (b) List unpublished articles:

    ```sh
    https dev.to/api/articles/me/unpublished api-key:$API_KEY
    ```

    To make publishing easier, each post in this repository is a directory corresponding to that ID.

3.  Move to that directory and then upload the article text:

    ```sh
    python3 ../article.py index.md |
    https -v PUT dev.to/api/articles/${PWD##*/} api-key:$API_KEY
    ```

    The response to this request is the only way to retrieve the article from the API before it is published.

## Appendix: source code

The contents of `article.py` are below. This reads the markdown file and outputs a suitable JSON object:

<!-- embedme article.py -->

```py
from sys import argv
from json import dumps

with open(argv[-1]) as file_:
    output = {"body_markdown": file_.read()}
print(dumps({"article": output}))

```

I wrote a set of [tests for this code].
